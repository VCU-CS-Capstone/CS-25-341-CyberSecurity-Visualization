* Finish poster for senior design fair - Chris
* Continued set up on PI's identified issues regarding installation, attempted to diagnose and fix, gave 2 Pi's to Calvin for assisted debugging - Keith

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Figure out how to set up Zeek on Raspberry Pis. Set up a meeting with Melanie for help with Zeek - Calvin
* Collect the devices from Calvin and have them work with Zeek. Follow up with the team for Zeek process and attacking methodologies - Jaspreet
* Script for design fair and final fall report - Chris
* Continuing the process to fix the installation of Zeek - Keith

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Meeting with Todd is uncertain. We want to inquire about Zeek's setup on Linux as there are some issues regarding log creation. Having trouble setting up Zeek on the Raspberry Pis.
