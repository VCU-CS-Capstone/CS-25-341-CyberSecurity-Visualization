## Week 3

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Set up all three Raspberry Pis - Calvin
* More research into zeek, how to integrate with our specific context, best practices, and curating some useful code - Keith
* Found even more useful information on brute force attacks - Chris
* Got deep into brute force and DOS attack, via online and consulting Cyber Security Professional. - Jaspreet

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Write code for door Pis to communicate with the auth server. Look into RFID verification - Calvin
* Research brute force attack - Chris
* I will setup and perform actions on devices and have the results - Jaspreet
* use proxmark on personal computer to learn how it can be used with pi later on, make documentation for any important processes require for setup, look into how to exploit the RFID itself, setup slideshow - Keith
* Meeting with Jared Feb 26 - All

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Might have to change approach from zeek on pi to zeek on personal computer

## Week 2
