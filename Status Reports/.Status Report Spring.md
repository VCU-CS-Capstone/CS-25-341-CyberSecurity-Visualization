**Faculty Advisor:**
* Milos Manic

## Week 5

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Set up proxmark and updated some code in the door program. Working on debugging code - Keith
* Worked on Keith's updated code for communication between server and doors to include proxmark3 scanning - Calvin
* Found brute force code online - Chris
* Wrote the code for DOS attack - Jaspreet

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Run tests for authentication and start writing code for attacks - Calvin
* Finish debugging door code. start integration with Zeek once working and running with the authentication server - Keith
* Get some base code working in our servers - Chris
* Test attack on personal computer - Jaspreet

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Getting proxmark3 to run within the door.py thread has been proving to be difficult. We've had some problems with running pm3 within door.py.

## Week 4

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Coded communication between server and doors. Scheduled meeting with Jared - Calvin
* Researched code for a brute force attack - Chris
* Got proxmark running, getting experience with its capabilities and commands, documenting relevant info for our use case - Keith
* Worked on DOS attack code - Jaspreet
* Met with Jared to get help with creating a GUI - all

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Write code for the authentication process and run tests - Calvin
* More brute force research and start coding the attack - Chris
* Dive deeper into play between Zeek and proxmark - Keith

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* None

## Week 3

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Set up all three Raspberry Pis - Calvin
* More research into zeek, how to integrate with our specific context, best practices, and curating some useful code - Keith
* Found even more useful information on brute force attacks - Chris
* Got deep into brute force and DOS attack, via online and consulting Cyber Security Professional. - Jaspreet

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Write code for door Pis to communicate with the auth server. Look into RFID verification - Calvin
* Research brute force attack - Chris
* I will setup and perform actions on devices and have the results - Jaspreet
* use proxmark on personal computer to learn how it can be used with pi later on, make documentation for any important processes require for setup, look into how to exploit the RFID itself, setup slideshow - Keith
* Meeting with Jared Feb 26 - All

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Might have to change approach from zeek on pi to zeek on personal computer

## Week 2

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Attempted to set up server - Calvin
* More research into zeek, how to integrate with our specific context, best practices, and curating some useful code - Keith
* Found lots of useful information on brute force attacks we can use when planning and designing attacks - Chris
* Conducted DOS research and found codes - Jaspreet

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Set up all 3 servers - Calvin
* Research brute force attack - Chris
* Research more into DOS attacks - Jaspreet
* Find out more about how the RFID interacts with the Pi's to see what kind of network data we're working with - Keith
* Schedule a meeting with Jared - All

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Ran into device discovery issues when attempting to set up servers - Calvin

## Week 1

### 1) Accomplishments this week
* Ordered new Raspberry Pis with sufficient RAM

### 2) Milestones to be completed next week
* Set up new servers - Calvin
* Research brute force attack - Chris
* Research DOS attack - Jaspreet
* Look into how to create a visual from Zeek output - Keith

### 3) Issues, problems, or concerns
* Materials taking a long time to arrive
