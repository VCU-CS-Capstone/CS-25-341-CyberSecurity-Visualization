## 1) Accomplishments this week ##
   - Investigated methods of obtaining and sending information to and from an RFID scanner and started researching RFID antennas - Chris M
   - Researched connecting Pi board to WiFi. Found WiFi unnecessary as LAN should be sufficient - Calvin
   - Setup monitoring tools like  splunk and working on zeek coding but getting errors so have to do it from scratch - Working on Splunk if we can block the RFID device remotely if any breach happens - Learned that the RF IDs can be vanished if touched with magnet - Jaspreet
   - Successfully set up zeek on a local network and monitored traffic with logs and researched and proposed potential hardware ecosystem for attack simulation - Keith

## 2) Milestones to be completed next week ##
   -  - Chris M
   -  - Calvin
   -  - Jaspreet
   - Finishing orders for required materials - Keith
   - Project Proposal - ALL

## 3) Issues, problems, or concerns ##
   - Need additional clarity from Cyber Security research associate to finalize network architecture and attack model, schedule not yet decided
